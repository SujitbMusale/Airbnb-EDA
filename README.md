 AirBnb Booking Analysis
 
 This AirBNB dataset is a rich in data but not on features. From the entire above analysis we can conclude that,Most visitors don't prefer shared rooms, they tend to visit private room or entire home. Manhattan and Brooklyn are the two distinguished, expensive & posh areas of NY Though location of property has high relation on deciding its price, but a property in popular location doesn't mean it will stay occupied in most of the time.
